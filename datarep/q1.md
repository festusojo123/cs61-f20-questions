Data representation question
============================
<ol>
<li>Why will the following code fail when made with a sanitizer?
`int main() {
   void* ptr = malloc(3);
   free((char*) ptr + 6);
}`</li>

<li>How could you prevent this failure?</li>

<li>There are three major types of sanitizers discussed in this class: AddressSanitizer (detects addressability issues), LeakSanitizer (detects memory leaks), and MemorySanitizer (detects use of uninitialized memory). Which would this issue trigger/which would you find in the error message upon running `make SAN=1`?
<ol>
<li>AddressSanitizer</li>
<li>LeakSanitizer</li>
<li>MemorySanitizer</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Give an example of issues which would be caught by the other two types of sanitizers (not the one you selected for part c).</li>
</ol>
